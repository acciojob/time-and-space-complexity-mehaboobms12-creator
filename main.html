<h1> Time Space Complexity </h1>
	
	<p> a measure of how the runtime of an algorithm grows as the size of the input
		(typically denoted as n) increases. 
	     It's primarily analyzed using Big O notation to describe
	the worst-case scenario and compare algorithm efficiency in a machine-independent way. </p>

	<p>
		<b> Space complexity </b> in JavaScript is a measure of the total amount of memory an algorithm uses 
		relative to the size of its input (usually denoted as 'n')
