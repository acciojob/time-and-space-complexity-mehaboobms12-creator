<h1> Time And Space Complexity </h1>
	
	<p> Time complexity is understood as the time taken by a program to run and complete the given task.
		as programer your goal should reduce time complexity of the code by optimizing it and making it more efficiant
	</p>
<p>
		<b> Space complexity : </b>  Space complexity is related to the amount of memory occupied by
		a program.For example if a program takes an array of size n as input, the space complexity of the program becomes O(n).
